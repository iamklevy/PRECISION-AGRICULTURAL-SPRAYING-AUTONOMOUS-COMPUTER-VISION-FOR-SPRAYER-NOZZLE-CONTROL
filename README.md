# PRECISION AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING: AUTONOMOUS COMPUTER VISION FOR SPRAYER NOZZLE CONTROL

Abstract— In modern agriculture, the precise application of pesticides is critical for enhancing crop yields while mitigating environmental impacts. This study presents an innovative system that leverages computer vision to control tractor-mounted sprayer nozzles for precision pesticide application. The system uses a Raspberry Pi for real-time image processing and an Arduino for controlling the sprayer nozzles, ensuring targeted spraying on crops. This minimizes pesticide wastage and environmental contamination. Key components include image segmentation algorithms, remote control mechanisms, and a user-friendly mobile interface. Evaluations demonstrate significant reductions in pesticide use and improvements in application accuracy. This research advances precision agriculture by providing a scalable, efficient, and eco-friendly solution for autonomous pesticide spraying
Keywords— Precision Agriculture, Autonomous Systems, Computer Vision, Pesticide Spraying, Tractor-Mounted Sprayers, Crop Row Detection.

The autonomous nozzle control system aims to optimize pesticide application in crop fields. It consists of several interconnected components as shown in figure 1.
